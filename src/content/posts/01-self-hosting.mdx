## Overview

This tutorial walks through setting up a small self-hosted server: hardware choices, OS installation (Ubuntu Server), configuring SSH, a basic firewall, and deploying a simple static site.

### 1. Hardware and Network

- Use a low-power mini PC or Raspberry Pi 4 for small projects.
- Ensure your router supports port forwarding or use a reverse proxy/tunnel (Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale) if no static IP.

### 2. Install OS

Install Ubuntu Server LTS, enable SSH, and update packages:

```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### 3. Create a user, enable SSH key auth, disable password auth

```bash
adduser youruser
mkdir -p /home/youruser/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/youruser/.ssh
echo "<your-public-key>" > /home/youruser/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /home/youruser/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown -R youruser:youruser /home/youruser/.ssh
```

### 4. Firewall (ufw)

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

### 5. Reverse proxy and TLS

Use Caddy or Nginx + Certbot for TLS. Caddy is easy for automatic TLS.

### 6. Deploy your site

Copy files via `scp` or use git to pull code to the server. Serve static sites via Nginx or a simple file server.
